# PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT

The **PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT** focuses on automating, managing, and maintaining the underlying infrastructure that supports the PR-CYBR ecosystem. It ensures high availability, scalability, and reliability of cloud and on-premises resources while adhering to security best practices.

## Key Features

- **Cloud Infrastructure Automation**: Deploys and manages cloud resources via Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implements observability tools to monitor resource health and performance.
- **Scalability Management**: Optimizes resource allocation for scaling based on usage patterns.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Automates backup and recovery processes to ensure data resilience.
- **Security Compliance**: Integrates security standards into infrastructure configurations.

## Getting Started

2. **Set Repository Secrets**:
   - Navigate to your forked repository's `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
   - Add infrastructure-specific secrets (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `TERRAFORM_BACKEND_KEY`).
3. **Enable GitHub Actions**:
   - Ensure that GitHub Actions is enabled for automated IaC workflows.
4. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   - Run the following commands locally or rely on GitHub Actions for automated deployment:
     ```bash
