# Engagement Summary Document Schema

The engagement summary Markdown should contain the following canonical sections:

1. `# Weekly Commit Highlights`
2. `## Contributors to Celebrate` with a bullet list of `@username` entries.
3. `## Key Metrics` table with columns `Metric`, `Value`, `Change`.
4. `## Follow-up Actions` enumerated list linking to tickets or discussions.

Agents parsing the file may rely on these exact headings to insert additional
context or annotations.
