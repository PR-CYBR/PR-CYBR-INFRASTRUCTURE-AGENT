# Remediation Advisory Document Schema

The remediation advisory generated by the vulnerability workflow should follow this structure:

1. **Front matter** (YAML)
   - `service`: string service identifier.
   - `generated_at`: ISO 8601 timestamp.
   - `owners`: list of team identifiers.
2. **Sections**
   - `Summary`: high-level description of top risks.
   - `Critical Findings`: markdown table with columns `ID`, `Component`, `Severity`, `Fix`
   - `Recommended Actions`: ordered list of prioritized steps.
   - `Next Review`: statement describing review cadence.

Downstream agents may parse the front matter to determine routing and rely on the section
headings remaining stable.
