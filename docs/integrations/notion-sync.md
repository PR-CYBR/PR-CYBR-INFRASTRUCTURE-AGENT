# Notion Sync Integration

## Goals
- Deliver a repeatable workflow for syncing infrastructure runbooks and operational data between Notion and the PR-CYBR infrastructure agent.
- Follow the process, review, and deployment conventions defined in the [spec-bootstrap](https://github.com/PR-CYBR/spec-bootstrap/) reference repository.
- Keep the integration modular so that additional automation (notifications, Terraform variables, etc.) can be layered in without refactoring core logic.

## Dependencies
- **Notion API access** configured through Terraform Cloud Workspace environment variables, keeping secrets out of the repository in line with spec-bootstrap practices.
- **Python packages** required by the sync scripts (update `requirements.txt` as new libraries are introduced) and ensure compatibility with existing agent tooling.
- **CI/CD pipelines** inherited from spec-bootstrap, including linting and automated checks, must pass before merging into protected branches.

## Branch Strategy
- Do all implementation work on feature branches that follow the spec-bootstrap naming standard, for example `feature/notion-sync`.
- Reserve the `main` branch for protected release merges that have passed review, testing, and CI validation.
- Use pull requests to merge feature branches into `develop` or the designated integration branch before promoting to `main`, preserving the multi-stage promotion flow described in spec-bootstrap.
