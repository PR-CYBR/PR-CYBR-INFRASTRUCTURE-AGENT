# OPORD-PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENTâ€™s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be accomplished through executing a setup script that utilizes TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
Reliable and scalable infrastructure is crucial for supporting the operations and services of the PR-CYBR initiative. Updates to infrastructure management practices are necessary to align with growing user demands and operational efficiency.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will ensure that the script incorporates `scripts/setup.sh` to execute TMUX and create the specified interactive terminal windows.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
This mission will focus on enhancing infrastructure management capabilities and ensuring seamless interaction through the terminal setup.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Modify `src/main.py` to initialize the terminal program appropriately.
   - Adjust `scripts/setup.sh` to automate repository cloning and TMUX setup.
   - Update `setup.py` to reflect any new infrastructure requirements.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to validate new infrastructure functionalities.
   - Revise `README.md` to include updated procedures and instructions for users.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Set up the following terminal windows:
     - **Window 1**: Provide a welcome message, options, and a loading progress bar.
     - **Window 2**: Execute `htop` for system monitoring.
     - **Window 3**: Use `tail -f` to observe logs generated by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Display output of `ls -l` in the repository root directory.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Ensure all updates are documented and maintained in the version control system.
- Conduct a review session post-implementation to assess infrastructure changes.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Provide regular updates on infrastructure status and performance through established PR-CYBR channels.
- Ensure that all agents understand the new infrastructure capabilities.

**This OPORD directs the PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT to enhance operational effectiveness and align efforts with PR-CYBR goals.**
