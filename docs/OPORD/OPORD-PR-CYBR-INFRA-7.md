# OPORD-PR-CYBR-INFRA-7

## 1. Situation
The PR-CYBR initiative aims to bolster cybersecurity preparedness and resilience across Puerto Rico. The `PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT` is tasked with ensuring the integrity, availability, and security of the underlying infrastructure.

## 2. Mission
The PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT will develop and implement a local testing environment utilizing `act` to enhance CI/CD workflows for all PR-CYBR agents. This will involve creating a curl-based setup script that other agents can utilize to test their workflows locally against the infrastructure provisioning processes.

## 3. Execution
### A. Concept of Operations
1. **Design**: Create an architecture for the testing environment that supports local execution of workflows for all agents.
2. **Implementation**: Utilize `act` to simulate the GitHub Actions environment locally.
3. **Collaboration**: Coordinate with the PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT to ensure consistency with existing workflows.
4. **Documentation**: Document the processes and procedures for utilizing the new testing environment, ensuring all agents have access to necessary resources.

### B. Tasks
1. **Research and Development**:
   - Explore the capabilities and requirements of `act` to facilitate local testing.
   - Develop scripts for setting up the local environment, running tests, and leveraging Docker containers where necessary.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Create a setup script (refer to the following repository for templates and examples):
     - [Local Setup Script](https://github.com/PR-CYBR/PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT/blob/main/scripts/local_setup.sh)
   - Enable curl functionality for other agents to access the setup script directly.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Run tests using the new setup to validate infrastructure provisioning and ensure compliance with operational standards.
   - Gather feedback from other agents for continuous improvement of testing processes.

## 4. Service Support
### A. Logistics
The primary tool for local testing (`act`) relies on Docker. Ensure all team members have Docker installed and functioning on their machines. 

### B. Communication
Regular updates and findings should be documented and shared via the PR-CYBR Project Board. Utilize the discussion board for ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## 5. Command and Signal
Maintain an open line of communication between all agents. The PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT will act as the primary point of contact for this OPORD.
